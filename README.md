## A SUMMARY OF MY KINGDOM_ANIMALIA_CLASS

### BASE CLASS ANIMALIA
- A base class named Animalia is defined with a constructor method, initializing properties for the _name, _type, _backbone type, and _blood type.
- A private method #hiddenFunction is declared for encapsulation.
- A common method makeSound is defined, which calls the private method #callhiddenFunction for abstraction.

### INHERITANCE AND DERIVED CLASSES
- A derived class WithBackbone extends the base class Animalia.
- The constructor sets the backboneType property using the super keyword.
- The makeSound method is overridden to provide a specific sound for animals with a backbone. It calls the super.makeSound() method, which indirectly calls the private method #hiddenFunction from the base class.
- Another derived class WithoutBackbone is declared, extending the Animalia base class.
- The makeSound method is overridden to provide a different sound for animals without a backbone. It calls the super.makeSound() method.
- A new derived class ColdBlooded is declared, extending the Animalia base class.
- The makeSound method is overridden to provide a specific sound for cold-blooded animals. It calls the super.makeSound() method.
- Another new derived class WarmBlooded is declared, extending the Animalia base class.
- The makeSound method is overridden to provide a different sound for warm-blooded animals. It calls the super.makeSound() method.

### EXAMPLE USAGE
- Instances of the derived classes (WithBackbone, WithoutBackbone, ColdBlooded, WarmBlooded) are created with specific properties.
- The makeSound method is called on each instance, demonstrating polymorphism by producing different sounds based on the type of animal.
- The private method #hiddenFunction is indirectly invoked through the abstraction of the makeSound method in the base class.
