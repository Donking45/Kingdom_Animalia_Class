## Base Class Definition (Animalia):
- The Animalia class serves as the base class for various types of animals.
- It has private properties (#hiddenFunction) and public properties (name, type, backboneType, bloodType).
- The constructor initializes these properties with provided values.
- Encapsulation is demonstrated with the private method #hiddenFunction and the public method callHiddenFunction.
- Abstraction is illustrated with the common method makeSound.

## Inheritance:
- Derived classes (WithBackbone, WithoutBackbone, ColdBlooded, WarmBlooded) inherit from the Animalia base class.
- Inherited properties and methods from Animalia are available to these derived classes.
- Each derived class can override the makeSound method to exhibit polymorphism.

### Derived Classes:
WithBackbone, WithoutBackbone, ColdBlooded, and WarmBlooded are specialized classes representing animals with and without a backbone, cold-blooded, and warm-blooded animals, respectively.
Each derived class uses super to call the constructor of the base class (Animalia).
Polymorphism is demonstrated through the overridden makeSound methods in each derived class.

### Example Usage:
Instances of the derived classes (lion, snake, butterfly, eagle) are created, showcasing polymorphism.
Each instance invokes the makeSound method, providing specific outputs based on the overridden implementations in the derived classes.

### Demonstration of Concepts:
The code illustrates key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as encapsulation (private method), abstraction (common method), inheritance, and polymorphism.
Encapsulation is achieved with private properties and methods, ensuring that certain functionality is hidden within the class.
Inheritance enables code reuse and promotes a hierarchical structure among classes.
Polymorphism allows different instances to respond to the same method (makeSound) in a way that is specific to their type.

In summary, the code models a simple hierarchy of animal classes, demonstrating how OOP principles can be applied for abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
